            <h1>I was born in London England, educated at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge & currently reside in Denmark. After spending numerous years working alongside a number of creative individuals, I found myself inpsired to create also. In 2019, I decided to make a major decision to re-edutate myself on the subject of Design</h1>
            <p id="" class="">Born in London, England to parents of caribean descent, I personally don't think I was the most creative child. Instead, most of my time was spent playing football.

                It wasn't until university when I first began to explore my creative side. Whilst Studying Social Policy at Anglia Ruskin University, I decided to take some time to also study fashion design at The London College of Fashion. This would be my first taste of creativity.<br>
                <br>

                Following Graduation from University in Social Policy, I was unsure whether I had chosen the right path. As a result I began to look for new areas of expertise whilst traveling the world. This Is how I began working in marketing in Munich, Germany. I began learning the ropes at a number of valuable internship positions including Becoacht, Sixt & Internations. Most notably during my time in Munich, I worked with the extremely talented team at COBE. Doing so was a great experience as I was able to put all the skills I had learnt into practice. Furthermore, I was able to do so in an environment that welcomed creativity and innovation.<br>
                <br>

                Following My departure from Munich, I briefly returned to the UK to tie the knot with my wife.<br>
                <br>

                I moved to denmark in 2017 and in 2019, I decided to enroll at KEA. Now I‚Äôm 1 year in and loving every second of it!</p>
