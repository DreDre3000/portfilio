            <p> In this theme, I was introduced to the basic terminology within user interface design, digital communication, user testing, and responsive web design. As a result, I was given the opportunity to get my hands on html and css coding as well as basic image processing (Photoshop) and vector drawing (Illustrator). During this theme, we‚Äôll cover basic web design from research and ideation to design and development for the web</p>

            <p>The following projects display key skills learned during this module and what I've learned from taking part </p>

            <p>Given that this was one of our first projects working directly with code, a lot of my research for this project was conducted within the class. Our lecturers informed us on CSS Grids, controlling the viewport and Media Queries.</p>
            <p>With this knowledge I was ready to begin creating a Responsive website .</p>

            <p>As it was my first attempt at coding, I found this project extremely difficult. The biggest challenge I faced was ‚Äúcurbing my ambitions. I often found myself aspiring to create a beautiful website that reflected my vision. Unfortunately due to my lack of knowledge on HTML and CSS, this was not possible. </p>

            <p>Additionally, I often find myself trying to find any means necessary to achieve my goal. As a result I use methods that are ‚Äúoutdated‚Äù. Thus giving me issues when attempting to validate my code. </p>


            <p>Nevertheless, today I feel a lot more confident working with code. I like to think this website serves as an example as to how my skills have improved in this area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="MainTextIdeation">
            <p>I tried to pay a lot of attention to the use of CSS Grids whilst creating this project. The thoughts behind this was to ensure that my content would maintain order when resizing.Additionally I made use of various colour in an effort to visually see how my grids were being diplayed.</p>
