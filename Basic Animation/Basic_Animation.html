            <p>During my third module at KEA I was given the opportunity to Learn Basic Animation. The aim of this Module was to understand the basic concepts of animation, Storytelling and character design.In addition we would be working with both CSS and Javascript to enhance our animations<br>
                <br>
                The Following three project highlight what I was able to achieve during this module.</p>

 As part of this, we were asked us to create a story that features at least two characters. Additionally we were asked to create a story that makes use of classic story-telling techniques. In order to achieve this I documented my intended narrative curve that ensures my story is entertaining for users.

As a new parent, I decided to create a story revolving around a crying baby who will not go to bed. In an attempt to make him happy, users are asked to give him food. ( the supporting cast in this story )

Overall, I‚Äôm really happy with the outcomes of this task. The designs convey the playful childish nature, whilst also displaying anger when necessary.

                 and asked us to thoroughly document our process from start to end. Here you can look into the finer details of our working process. The key learning from this project for me was design process itself. Due to the large scale of this task, design tasks were handled by myself and Patricia. Having a clear defined style was extremely helpful as it ensured both of us stayed on the same train out thought. I think this really helped tie our final product together.</p>

            <p>In another part of this module named 02.04.06, we were asked for a Link to our
                <a href="http://dredesigns.dk/KEA/Wizard%20of%20OZ/Tornado_scene_1/start_page/index.html" target="_blank">‚ÄúFinal Interactive Production. ‚Äù</a>

This was an interactive game that was aimed to help promote a film at the local movie theatre. Doing so meant that we had to rely heavily on CSS and Javascript.

During the inception of this project, We paid a great deal of attention on defining our style and our target audience. This can be seen in here in our Style Tile, Persona Collage & Moodboard.

The interactive game itself was coded by myself, Luciano & Hudesifer. We came across a lot of challenges during this process; however our combined knowledge was enough to ensure our product was finished on time.
